# OpenTelemetry File Storage Extension Test

This test demonstrates the OpenTelemetry File Storage Extension configuration for persistent state management in telemetry pipelines.

## üéØ What This Test Does

The test validates that the File Storage Extension can:
- Provide persistent storage for the filelog receiver to track file read positions
- Store state information across collector restarts
- Use compaction for storage optimization
- Handle file synchronization (fsync) for data durability
- Process application logs from files using a sidecar pattern

## üìã Test Resources

### 1. Namespace RBAC and Security Configuration
The test configures OpenShift-specific security settings:
```bash
# Role binding for pod view access
kubectl create rolebinding default-view-$NAMESPACE --role=pod-view --serviceaccount=$NAMESPACE:ta

# Security context constraints
kubectl annotate namespace ${NAMESPACE} openshift.io/sa.scc.uid-range=1000/1000 --overwrite
kubectl annotate namespace ${NAMESPACE} openshift.io/sa.scc.supplemental-groups=3000/1000 --overwrite
```

### 2. Main Collector (Debug Output)

          receivers: [filelog]
          processors: []
          exporters: [otlp]
  volumeMounts:
  - name: log-data
    mountPath: /log-data
  - name: filestorageext
    mountPath: /filestorageext/data
  - name: filestorageext
    mountPath: /filestorageext/compaction
```

### 4. Log Generator Application
The test includes a log generator application that writes logs to files which are then collected by the sidecar collector.

## üöÄ Test Steps

1. **Create OTEL Collector** - Deploy main collector with debug exporter and configure namespace RBAC
2. **Create Log Generator App** - Deploy application that generates plaintext logs
3. **Wait for Log Collection** - Allow 10 seconds for logs to be processed
4. **Check Collected Logs** - Verify logs are collected and forwarded to main collector
5. **Confirm File Storage Extension** - Verify file storage extension creates required state files

## üîç File Storage Extension Configuration

### Storage Settings:
- **Storage Directory**: `/filestorageext/data`
- **Timeout**: 1 second for storage operations
- **Fsync**: Enabled for data durability and crash consistency

### Compaction Configuration:
- **On Start**: Enabled to optimize storage on collector startup
- **Compaction Directory**: `/filestorageext/compaction`
- **Max Transaction Size**: 65,536 bytes per transaction

### Integration with Filelog Receiver:
- **Storage Reference**: `storage: file_storage`
- **File Pattern**: `/log-data/*.log`
- **State Persistence**: Tracks file read positions across restarts

### Log Processing:
- **Parser**: Regex parser for structured log extraction
- **Timestamp Parsing**: Extracts timestamps from log entries
- **Severity Parsing**: Maps log levels to OpenTelemetry severity

## üîç Verification

The test verification includes two checks:

### 1. Log Processing Verification:
Confirms that logs are successfully collected from files and forwarded to the main collector.

### 2. File Storage Extension Verification:
The `check_filestorageext.sh` script verifies that the file storage extension creates state files:
- Checks for `receiver_filelog_` files in `/filestorageext/data`
- Checks for `receiver_filelog_` files in `/filestorageext/compaction`
- Confirms both storage and compaction directories contain the expected state files

## üßπ Cleanup

The test runs in a dynamically created namespace and all resources are cleaned up automatically when the test completes.

## üìù Key Configuration Notes

- Uses sidecar deployment pattern for log collection with file storage
- Demonstrates persistent state management for filelog receiver
- Configures both storage and compaction directories for optimal performance
- Enables fsync for data durability in production-like scenarios
- Shows integration between file storage extension and log processing pipeline
- Validates state file creation in both main storage and compaction directories
