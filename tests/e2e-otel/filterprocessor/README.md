# OpenTelemetry Filter Processor Test

This test demonstrates the OpenTelemetry Filter processor configuration for filtering out unwanted telemetry data.

## üéØ What This Test Does

The test validates that the Filter processor can:
- Filter traces based on span and resource attributes
- Filter metrics based on metric names and resource attributes  
- Filter logs based on log body content
- Only allow "green" telemetry data while filtering out "red" data

## üìã Test Resources

### 1. OpenTelemetry Collector with Filter Processor

        metrics:
          metric:

### 2. Telemetry Data Generator
The test generates traces, metrics, and logs with various attributes and content to test the filtering capabilities.

## üöÄ Test Steps

1. **Create OTEL Collector** - Deploy collector with filter processor
2. **Generate Telemetry Data** - Send traces, metrics, and logs with both "red" and "green" attributes
3. **Wait for Processing** - Allow 5 seconds for telemetry data to be processed
4. **Check Filtered Data** - Verify that only "green" data passes through while "red" data is filtered out

## üîç Filter Rules Applied

### Trace Filtering:
- **Filter out**: Spans with `traces-env` attribute equal to "red"
- **Filter out**: Spans with resource attribute `traces-colour` equal to "red"
- **Allow through**: Spans with `traces-colour` equal to "green"

### Metric Filtering:
- **Filter out**: Metrics named "gen" with resource attribute `metrics-colour` equal to "red"
- **Allow through**: Metrics with `metrics-colour` equal to "green"

### Log Filtering:
- **Filter out**: Log records containing "drop message" in the body
- **Allow through**: Other log records

## üîç Verification

The test verification script checks for:

**Expected Data (should be present):**
- `logs-colour: Str(green)` - Green logs passed through
- `metrics-colour: Str(green)` - Green metrics passed through  
- `traces-colour: Str(green)` - Green traces passed through

**Filtered Data (should NOT be present):**
- `logs-colour: Str(red)` - Red logs filtered out
- `metrics-colour: Str(red)` - Red metrics filtered out
- `traces-colour: Str(red)` - Red traces filtered out

## üßπ Cleanup

The test runs in the default namespace and all resources are cleaned up automatically when the test completes.

## üìù Key Configuration Notes

- Uses `error_mode: ignore` to continue processing even if filter errors occur
- Filters apply to all three telemetry data types: traces, metrics, and logs
- Filter conditions use OTTL (OpenTelemetry Transformation Language) expressions
- Supports complex conditions with logical operators and functions
- Debug exporter allows verification of filtered data output
