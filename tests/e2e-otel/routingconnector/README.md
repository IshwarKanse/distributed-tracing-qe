# OpenTelemetry Routing Connector Test

This test demonstrates the OpenTelemetry Routing connector configuration for conditionally routing telemetry data to different pipelines and backends.

## üéØ What This Test Does

The test validates that the Routing connector can:
- Route traces to different Tempo instances based on tenant attributes
- Use conditional statements to determine routing destinations
- Support default routing for traces that don't match specific conditions
- Forward traces to red, blue, or green Tempo instances based on X-Tenant attribute

## üìã Test Resources

### 1. Multiple Tempo Instances
The test deploys three separate Tempo monolithic instances:
- `red` - for traces with X-Tenant=red
- `blue` - for traces with X-Tenant=blue  
- `green` - for traces with no matching tenant (default)

### 2. OpenTelemetry Collector with Routing Connector

### 3. Trace Generators
The test generates traces with different tenant attributes to test the routing logic.

## üöÄ Test Steps

1. **Create Tempo Instances** - Deploy three Tempo monolithic instances (red, blue, green)
2. **Check Tempo Status** - Verify all three Tempo instances are ready
3. **Create OTEL Collector** - Deploy collector with routing connector
4. **Generate Traces** - Send traces with different X-Tenant attributes
5. **Verify Traces** - Check that traces are routed to the correct Tempo instances

## üîç Routing Logic

### Routing Rules:
1. **Red Route**: `route() where attributes["X-Tenant"] == "red"`
   - Routes to `traces/red` pipeline ‚Üí `tempo-red` instance
   
2. **Blue Route**: `route() where attributes["X-Tenant"] == "blue"`
   - Routes to `traces/blue` pipeline ‚Üí `tempo-blue` instance

3. **Default Route**: `default_pipelines: [traces/green]`
   - Routes traces without matching X-Tenant to `tempo-green` instance

### Pipeline Architecture:
- **Input Pipeline**: `traces/in` - Receives all traces via OTLP
- **Routing Connector**: Routes traces based on X-Tenant attribute
- **Output Pipelines**: 
  - `traces/red` - Sends to red Tempo instance
  - `traces/blue` - Sends to blue Tempo instance  
  - `traces/green` - Sends to green Tempo instance (default)

### Error Handling:
- **Error Mode**: `ignore` - Continue processing even if routing errors occur
- **Fallback**: Default pipeline handles traces that don't match any routing rules

## üîç Verification

The test verification confirms that:
- Traces with `X-Tenant=red` are stored in the red Tempo instance
- Traces with `X-Tenant=blue` are stored in the blue Tempo instance
- Traces without X-Tenant or with other values are stored in the green Tempo instance
- All routing rules function correctly and traces reach their intended destinations

## üßπ Cleanup

The test runs in the `chainsaw-routecnctr` namespace and all resources are cleaned up automatically when the test completes.

## üìù Key Configuration Notes

- Uses conditional routing based on trace attributes for multi-tenant scenarios
- Supports default routing for traces that don't match specific conditions
- Demonstrates fan-out from single input to multiple output pipelines
- Each routing rule can target different processing pipelines and exporters
- Enables tenant isolation by routing traces to separate backend systems
