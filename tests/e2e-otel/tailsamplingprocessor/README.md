# OpenTelemetry Tail Sampling Processor Test

This test demonstrates the OpenTelemetry Tail Sampling processor configuration for intelligent trace sampling based on complete trace information.

## üéØ What This Test Does

The test validates that the Tail Sampling processor can:
- Wait for complete trace spans before making sampling decisions
- Apply multiple sampling policies (status code, latency, span count, service name)
- Forward sampled traces to Tempo for storage and verification
- Process traces from both generated telemetry and HotROD application

```

### 3. HotROD Application Deployment
The test deploys the HotROD (Rides on Demand) demo application which generates realistic traces with various characteristics for testing the sampling policies.

### 4. Trace Generators
- HotROD traffic generation to create traces with different patterns
- Telemetrygen job to create additional test traces

## üöÄ Test Steps

1. **Create Tempo Instance** - Deploy Tempo monolithic instance for trace storage
2. **Check Tempo Status** - Verify Tempo instance is ready
3. **Create OTEL Collector** - Deploy collector with tail sampling processor
4. **Install HotROD App** - Deploy the rides-on-demand demo application
5. **Generate HotROD Traces** - Create traffic to generate realistic traces
6. **Generate Additional Traces** - Send more traces using telemetrygen
7. **Verify Traces** - Check that sampled traces are received in Tempo

## üîç Sampling Policies Applied

### 1. Status Code Policy
- **Name**: `status-code-policy`
- **Type**: `status_code`
- **Rule**: Sample traces with ERROR status codes
- **Purpose**: Ensure all error traces are captured

### 2. Latency Policy
- **Name**: `latency-policy`
- **Type**: `latency`
- **Rule**: Sample traces with latency between 5000ms and 10000ms
- **Purpose**: Capture slow but not extremely slow requests

### 3. Span Count Policy
- **Name**: `span-count-policy`
- **Type**: `span_count`
- **Rule**: Sample traces with 39-50 spans
- **Purpose**: Focus on complex traces with many operations

### 4. Service Name Policy
- **Name**: `service-name-policy`
- **Type**: `string_attribute`
- **Rule**: Sample traces from services named "customer"
- **Purpose**: Ensure traces from critical service are sampled

## üîß Configuration Parameters

- **Decision Wait**: 30 seconds - Time to wait for complete trace before sampling decision
- **Num Traces**: 50,000 - Maximum number of traces to keep in memory
- **Expected New Traces Per Sec**: 20 - Expected trace rate for memory management
- **Policy Evaluation**: OR logic - Trace is sampled if ANY policy matches

## üßπ Cleanup

The test runs in the `chainsaw-tailsmp` namespace and all resources are cleaned up automatically when the test completes.

## üìù Key Configuration Notes

- Uses tail-based sampling requiring complete trace information before decisions
- Multiple policies with OR logic - any matching policy triggers sampling
- Integrates with Tempo for trace storage and Jaeger UI for verification
- Handles both generated telemetry and realistic application traces
- Balances comprehensive error capture with selective sampling of normal traces
